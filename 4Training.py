Setting the training class
ChatterBot comes with training classes built in, or you can create your own if needed.

Training with corpus data
ChatterBot comes with a corpus data and utility module that

To do so, simply specify the corpus data modules you want to use.

You can also specify file paths to corpus files or directories
 of corpus files when calling the train method.

Training with the Ubuntu dialog corpus
This training class will handle the process of downloading the compressed corpus file

If the file has already been downloaded, it will not be downloaded again. 
If the file is already extracted, it will not be extracted again.
